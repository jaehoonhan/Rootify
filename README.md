## Overview
### Description
An app that identifies indoor plants and tracks their watering, potting, and sunlight cycles.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Home & Garden
- **Mobile:** OCR API (Camera), Real time reminders. This app would be primarily developed for mobile usage, but is viable for usage with limited functionality on a computer. 
- **Story:** The app analyzes users' plant needs and routine. Users can add their plants through a OCR API that recognizes the type of plant to add to their library. It keep tracks of watering schedules and reminds users of care cycles to maximize plant life.
- **Market:** This app is open for use by any individual as a plant identifier, but the app's full functionality is specifically targeted towards plant owners.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wants depending on the plant collection the user has and how often it is updated.
- **Scope:** The app will identify a plant through an OCR API, then it will be added to the users database of plants. The user can view their plant collection and each plant will have a profile of maintenance info. The app can make reminders according to the plant's maintenance requirements.
